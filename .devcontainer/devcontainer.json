  // dockerComposeFile: Specifies the Docker Compose file(s) used to define the dev container environment.
  // Details: An array of paths (relative to devcontainer.json) to one or more docker-compose.yml files. VS Code will use 
  //    Docker Compose to build and run the services defined within these files instead of using the 'build' or 'image' properties. 
  //    Requires the 'service' property to also be defined.
  // Use Case: Define multi-container development environments (e.g., application + database + cache) or manage complex 
  //    single-service configurations using Docker Compose.

  // Details: This value MUST match the name of a service defined in the docker-compose.yml file(s) listed in 'dockerComposeFile'. 
  //    VS Code will connect its UI and terminal to this specific container.
  // Use Case: Required when using 'dockerComposeFile' to identify the primary development container among potentially multiple 
  //    services (like app, database, etc.).

  // Use Case: Ensures VS Code opens the correct folder containing your project code within the container environment.

  // portsAttributes: Provides additional configuration for forwarded ports.
  // Details: An object mapping port numbers (as strings) to settings like 'label', 'onAutoForward', 'protocol'.

  // EXAMPLE - "install dev tools" : "bash .devcontainer/install-dev-tools.sh"

  // postStartCommand: Executes a command/script EVERY time the container starts.

  // postAttachCommand: Executes a command/script EVERY time VS Code attaches to the container.
  // Timing: Runs after VS Code connects to the already running container (including on window reloads).
