# This base image is chosen because it has all of the basic requirements preinstalled, 
# such as python, CUDA, CUDnn and should be GPU enabled by default.
# Several tensorflow/tensorflow images are broken by default and either require significant rework to become functional, 
# or are incompatible with Windows.

# It is also possible to specify a variant using build arguments passed from devcontainer.json.
# ARG VARIANT=2.16.1-gpu
# FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:${VARIANT}

# Specify the TensorFlow image variant to use. This is a known good image that works well.
